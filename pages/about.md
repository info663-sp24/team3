## About _Calabash: A Journal of Caribbean Arts & Letters_

This demo collection features items from New York University's archive of Calabash: A Journal of Caribbean Arts & Letters, and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).

_Calabash: A Journal of Caribbean Arts and Letters_Â was an international literary journal dedicated to publishing works encompassing, but not limited to, the Anglophone, Francophone, Hispanophone and Dutch-speaking Caribbean. The Journal was especially dedicated to presenting the arts and letters of those communities that have long been under-represented within the creative discourse of the region, among them: Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles, Maroon societies, and the Asian and Amerindian societies of the region. _Calabash_ had a strong visual arts component.
